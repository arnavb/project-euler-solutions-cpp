## Contributing

1. #### Pull Requests
   Unfortunately, since this is a solo project being done by me, I will not accept pull requests of any kind. Therefore, any opened pull requests will be immediately closed.
2. #### Issues
   If an error is found in one of my solutions, feel free to open an issue here, specifying _exactly_ what went wrong and where, so I can easily fix it.
